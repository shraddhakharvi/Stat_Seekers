## 🛠 Project Phases

### 🔍 **1. Planning Phase**

✔ Defined project objectives and approach.  
✔ Acquired and assessed the Spotify dataset.  
✔ Outlined the workflow for **data processing, SQL integration, and dashboard creation**.

### 🐍 **2. Python Phase (EDA & Data Cleaning)**

✔ Loaded the dataset using **pandas**.  
✔ Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify missing values and outliers.  
✔ Cleaned the data by handling missing values and standardizing formats.  
✔ Created new **derived columns** for better analysis.  
✔ Saved the cleaned dataset for SQL integration.

### 🗄 **3. SQL Phase (Database Integration)**

✔ Designed a **relational database schema** to store the cleaned dataset.  
✔ Used **SQLAlchemy/pandas** to load data into **SQL tables**.  
✔ Optimized queries for **efficient data retrieval**.

### 📊 **4. Power BI Phase (Dashboard & Analysis)**

✔ Connected **Power BI** to the SQL database.  
✔ Built an **interactive dashboard** to visualize **song popularity, artist trends, and track characteristics**.  
✔ Implemented **filters and visualizations** to analyze different aspects of the dataset.
